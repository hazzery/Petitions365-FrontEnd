# Petitions365 React Application

This project was created as an assignment for my 3rd year web computing course.
The project was to make a frond end React application for the REST API we developed earlier in the course.
My API can be found [here](https://github.com/hazzery/Petitions365-BackEnd).

## Running locally

1. Use `npm install` to populate the `node_modules/` directory with up to date packages.
2. Run the API server. [Details here](https://github.com/hazzery/Petitions365-BackEnd/blob/main/README.md)
3. Run `npm run dev` to boot the application.
4. Open a browser to `http://localhost:5173/`
